# Custom Online Logbook V1.0.0

---

This is a custom logbook made with streamlit and python. This is the first iteration of my free alternative to apps like Log10.
I want this logbook to become my own personal primary logbook.

## Features
- Adding flights
- Viewing all of your records on a statistics dashboard
- Revisiting old logs

---

## Future Iteration
- To make it online availible
- Add sign ins
- Add a signature feature
- Provide more detailed options when logging a flight
- Create a fully detailed CSV report on hours
- Make this into a mobile accessible application

## How To Use

Download the files to your local editor, then place addflights.py, stats.py, and viewlogs.py into a folder named sections. 
Place flights.db into a folder called data.

Then run: streamlit run main.py
